20231214 Modification on Pathfinder
Author: Yi-Ting Lin
Provided files: Pathfinder.py, appTrial.py, mwm_data_transform231209.m
Language: Python, Matlab
Environment and version: 
	For Python the program is run in Anaconda3, the scripts are modified and tested in Python 3.7.3.
	For Matlab the script is created and tested in R2018b.
Operating system:
	The Python original source codes supported Windows, Mac, and Linux.
	Modifications are made and tested under Windows 10.
	The Matlab script is created and tested under Windows 10.
	(Update this information after testing in Mac.)

1. How to use the new version
	Go to C: -> user -> (your user name) -> Anaconda3 -> Lib -> site-packages -> SearchStrategyAnalysis
	Rename the original appTrial.py and Pathfinder.py as whatever name you like.
	(This is just to ensure that you still have the original source codes.)
	Move the new appTrial.py an Pathfinder.py to the folder SearchStrategyAnalysis, don't rename them.
	Run pathfinder in your preferred directory.

2. Notes on the heatmap function
	A new input field is added for specifying animal(s) you'd like to analyze.
	The input value can be single animal name or multiple names separated by <,>
	Note that additional space would cause error.
	e.g. if you have animal names as WMD_01, WMD_02, WMD_03, etc.
	(O) WMD_01
	(O) WMD_01,WMD_02
	(O) WMD_01,WMD_02,WMD_03
	(X) WMD_01, WMD_02
	(X) [WMD_01,WMD_02]
	(X) 01,02

	The same input rules apply to the trial(s) input field as well.
	It's plausible to specify animal(s) and trial(s) at the same time, 
	but please leave the day(s) input field as <All> for our Smart data.

3. Matlab script mwm_data_transform231209.m
	The Matlab script is provided for transforming Smart .xls output into a folder containing .xlsx data files.
	Each .xlsx file contains data of a single animal in a single trial.
	The Matlab script can be placed at the folder where you would like to analyze the data.
	The corresponding folder would be automatically created and can be selected in Pathfinder's "Open directory".

4. Other modifications
	(1) Plots for swimming track can be created for automatically detected trials.
	    In the original version, plots are created only for manually defined trials.
	    Animal, Day, Trial name can be detected and concatenated as plot names.
	    However, for user-defined softwares, under current modified version only .xlsx files are supported for detecting these names.
	    For softwares with .csv files, Animal name may be <None> and Trial name may be numbers like <1>, <2>, <3>, etc.

	(2) Batch analysis is now plausible
	    There was a bug in the original codes that made .xlsx files unable to be detected under user-defined software settings.
	    The bug is fixed in the current modification.
	    Use "Open directory" to load the folder containing your files and they will all be processed upon clicking the Calculate button.

	(3) Memorizing maze parameters
	    The parameters at the time you click the Calculate button would be stored.
	    These values would automatically be called the next time you initialize Pathfinder.
	    This function actually existed in the source codes, but the author commented it.
	    I uncomment it so it's working again now.
